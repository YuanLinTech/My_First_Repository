        <h2>The Basic Language of the Web: HTML</h2>
        <p>Posted by Jing Zhou on Wednesday, 24 November 2021.</p>
        <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental technologies: 
            HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.</p>
        <p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>

        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the
        content of a webpage (not a programming language). </p>
        <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web
        browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>
        
        <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The opening tag</li>
            <li>The closing tag</li>
            <li>The actual element</li>

        </ul>
